        <h1>Domain 1: Professional and ethical conduct</h1>

        <p>As a healthcare worker that is constantly dealing with patients, demonstrating professional and ethical conduct is something that I constantly achieve to do. This domain teaches us many aspects such as the importance of keeping patient confidentiality and our respect for cultural sensitivity. 
        <br><br>
        An example of a time that I was able to demonstrate professional and ethical conduct was during placement when a Muslim younger female woman needed an x-ray. Upon calling out her name and checking her details, I noticed that the patient looked uncomfortable around me. Before I started the examination, I checked with the patient if she was okay that I performed the examination to which she replied that she was not. Therefore, I told the patient to wait while I went to grab a female radiographer who then took over and completed the x-ray. The patient was very grateful and looked much more at ease when the female radiographer came.

        <h1>Domain 2: Professional communication and collaboration</h1>

        <p>As a radiographer, our ability to withold professional communication with coworkers and our patients is very important. This is definetely a skill that needs to be transferrable when I have graduated and ready to enter the workforce with other professional health care workers. 
        <br><br>
        An example of when I have demonstrated this domain is during one of my assessment tasks at university. This assessment task was the Health Care Challenge which required us to meet up with several other students of other health care professionals, such as doctor, nurses and even speech pathologists. We were give a case study, in which we had to work together and come up with a management plan for the patient in the case study. Here we each had to explain to each other what we thought was needed to be done in regards to our own field. Through our collaboration we were able to develop a management plan together that we all agreed on and was satisfied with.  We were then required to make a video, to showcase our skills in communicating with one another and also our ability to explain our management plan to the patient.

        <h1>Domain 4: radiation safety and risk management</h1>
        <p>The importance of radiation safety is something that is drilled in to all students when they first start this course. There is a great importance of achieving the ALARA principle at all times.
        <br><br>
        During my time at placements, we must demonstrate to our supervisors that we know what exposure factors are required for different types of patients, knowing whether we are over or underexposing our patient and if we are putting them at unnecessary risk.
        <br><br>
        This is also important when we are imaging paediatric patients.  Paediatric patients require us to minimise the amount of images we need to reduce unnecessary doses to young patients. Furthermore, we must ensure that parents who accompany their children during the x-rays must be given appropriate lead shielding as a means of radiation safely.
        <br><br>
        An example of a time I demonstrated radiation safety was during my time in theatre at my clinical placement at a large metropolitan hospital. During theatre, before exposing I must make sure that everyone in the room is either covered or protected behind a glass. If they are not, we must tell them to either leave the room or wait for them to wear the right protection. Before i am about to expose, i must make sure that I announce it loudly and clearly for everyone in the room to hear.
