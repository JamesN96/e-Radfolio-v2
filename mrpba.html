        <h1>Domain 2: Professional Communication and Collaboration</h1>

        <p>
        As a radiographer, our ability to withhold professional communication with co-workers and our patients is very important. This is definitely a skill that needs to be transferrable when I have graduated and ready to enter the workforce with other professional health care workers. An example of an assignment where I was able to demonstrate this domain was during one of our practical exams which was a simulation clinic. We were first split into groups where each group was initially assigned to a patient. Each one of these patients were actors who demonstrated the different types of patients that we would experience in the real world.
        <br><br>
        One member of the group would interact with the patient one at a time, showcasing our skills of communication with each patient. While each person was having their turn, the other members of the group would have to mark them and write down what they believe was done well and what was not. When the person had finished interacting with the patient, the other members of the group and also the actor would provide them with the feedback. The idea behind each student providing feedback to one another was to show whether we could effectively communicate with each other in a respective and professional manner.
        <br><br> 
        I have provided evidence through these two image of my marking criteria, with the relevant sections demonstrating my ability to communicate with my peers in a professional way.

        <h1>Domain 3: Evidenced Based Practice and Professional Learning</h1>

        <p>One assignment that required us to demonstrated evidence based practice was my Clinical Studies 4 written case study. We were all given a theoretical case study about a patient who was in the ICU and had many problems that would make it difficult to achieve a chest x-ray. We were required to describe how we would be able to achieve this taking into consideration, communication principles, manual handling and biomechanics, infection control, radiation safety and professional teamwork. 
        <br><br>
        However, the main part of this assignment was that we had to compare and discuss any differences in how this case might be handled in the clinical environment and compare it to what I have learnt in my theoretical studies at university. Being able to identify, access or collect information from credible sources, and interpret findings, applying clinical reasoningâ€™s to identify implications for practice are criteria required to demonstrate capability of this domain. These were achieved through my research of literature, using online resources such as journal articles and studies, to help strengthen my answers for this assignment. 
        <br><br>  
        Here are two links to two images of my marks and marking critera for this assignment from the USYD canvas website.

        <h1>Domain 4: radiation safety and risk management</h1>
        <p>The importance of radiation safety is something that is drilled in to all students when they first start this course. There is a great importance of achieving the ALARA principle at all times.
        <br><br>
        During my time at placements, we must demonstrate to our supervisors that we know what exposure factors are required for different types of patients, knowing whether we are over or underexposing our patient and if we are putting them at unnecessary risk.
        <br><br>
        This is also important when we are imaging paediatric patients.  Paediatric patients require us to minimise the amount of images we need to reduce unnecessary doses to young patients. Furthermore, we must ensure that parents who accompany their children during the x-rays must be given appropriate lead shielding as a means of radiation safely.
        <br><br>
        An example of a time I demonstrated radiation safety was during my time in theatre at my clinical placement at a large metropolitan hospital. During theatre, before exposing I must make sure that everyone in the room is either covered or protected behind a glass. If they are not, we must tell them to either leave the room or wait for them to wear the right protection. Before i am about to expose, i must make sure that I announce it loudly and clearly for everyone in the room to hear.
        <br><br>
        I have provided an <a href="img/Radiation-safety-evidence.jpeg">image</a> of my supervisor assessment from my time at clinical placement showing my achievement of this domain.
