        <h1>Domain 1: Professional and ethical conduct</h1>

        <p>A situation were I was able to demonstrate my capability of professional and ethical conduct was thorugh our assignment of the simulation clinic. Here we had to learn how to interact with a a variety of different patient. We also learnt the importance of patient confidentiality. Respect for cultural sensitivity. Empathy

        <h1>Domain 2: Professional communication and collaboration</h1>

        <p>This can be demonstrated through my health care challenge assmesnt task. This task required us to meet up with students of other health science and collaborate with one another to come up with a management plan for a specific patient in a case study. Everyone here had their own part and gave out their own ideas and provided their knowledge in their field â€¦ We were required to make a video -> again require teamwork, making sure we were sll on the same page and we were happy with what we were doing. During placements, in situations where the patient is a NESB patient. Being able to come up of ways to effectively communicate to the patient non-verbally. 
        Evidence: supervisor comments? HCC marks

        <h1>Domain 4: radiation safety and risk management</h1>
        <p>The importance of radiation safety is something that is drilled in to all students when they first start this course. The importance of achieving the ALARA principle. During my time at placements, we must demonstrate to our supervisors that we know what exposure factors are required for different types of patients. Knowing when to go up or down . That for paediatrics we must minimise the amount of images we need and ensuring that parents who accompany their children during the x-rays must be given appropriate lead shielding. During theatre as well, before exposing we must make sure that everyone in the room is either covered or protected behind a glass. Piece of evidence ?( look in the supervisor form and grab the section of radiation safety?)
