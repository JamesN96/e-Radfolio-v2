            <h2>Inventiveness</h2>
            <article class="border" id="inventiveness">
                Inventiveness is an important quality that I believe a radiographer should have. It will be required as radiographers come to face patients with different conditions and circumstances. The radiographer will need to be inventive, if the normal way of performing an image is not possible and therefore a different and creative method will have to be used.
                <br><br>
                During my time at university, the Health Care Challenge assessment task provided me with the opportunity to showcase my inventiveness. This assessment task required us to make a video about my groups life management plan for the patient in our given case study. We were required to create the video in a creative way. To do so, we decided to use animation as a unique method of designing our video in order to get our information in a fun way. 
                <br><br>
                Here is a link to the video to our Health Care Challenge assessment task.

                <h2>Influence</h2>
            </div>
            <article class="border" id="influence">
                Another capability that I have developed is my ability of influence. While working as a casual radiographer, the influence that I had was towards an undergraduate student who was on their placement block at the same time. The student had just started out and therefore I was able to teach her many things that I knew and learnt during my placement blocks. Furthermore, as we were both students, I could relate to their problems and questions as I was in the same position not too long before. 
                <br><br>
                In order to be an influential person to this student, I made sure to be patient with the student and to make sure that I treat them with respect and politeness. This made it easier for me to address the problems that they were having and it made them feel more comfortable in asking me questions, which I always encouraged.  
                <br><br>
                Here is a signed supervisor comment about my ability with helping teach the student.
