                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>One of the main learning skills that I was able to develop was the ability to reflect. There were many assignments during our course that required us to reflect afterwards. We were required to reflect on what we thought we did well and what areas we could have improved on. An example of an assignment where we did reflection was during one of our practical exams which was a simulation clinic. We were first split into groups where each group was initially assigned to a patient. Each one of these patients were actors who demonstrated the different types of patients that we would experience in the real world. 
                <br><br>
                One member of the group would interact with the patient one at a time, showcasing our skills of communication with each patient. While each person was having their turn, the other memebers of the group would have to mark them and write down what they believe was done well and what was not. When the person had finished interacting with the patient,the other members of the group and also the actor would provide them with the feedback. At the end of the practical, we were then required to write a reflection on all the things we had learnt to highlight the areas that we were great at but also the areas that each person needed to improve on. 
                
                I believe that being able to reflect is a very important skill that we need to continuosly improve oneself. It allows us to see our mistakes and fix them and can also give us new ideas on how to tackle different situations.
                <br><br>
                Here is evidence of my ability to reflect.

                <h1>Self-Assesment</h1>
                <p>Self-assessment is another learning ability that I was able to improve on during my time at university. I was continuously assessing myself, learning through my mistakes. I strongly believe that this is an important skill to have, as we must have the ability to improve ourselves, especially when in the work force.
                <br><br>
                There are plenty of times throughout my clinical placements that I was required to assess myself. For example, during clinical placements we were required to gain competencies of different parts of the body. One view that I had a lot of difficulty with was the lateral y shoulder view. In order to gain the shoulder competency, I continuously practiced this view, making notes of all the reasons that I did not achieve a perfect image. By understanding all the things that I did wrong, led me to be very confident in my ability to perform this view now and allowed to me achieve competency for the shoulder. This was true for every position that I found difficult to perform.
                <br><br>
                Evidence of my shoulder competency or all competencies.

            <article id="learning-3" class="display-none">
                <h1>Judgement</h1>
                <p>Another important learning skill that I have developed is the ability of judgement. This means that I am able to make my own decisions that are based on previous knowledge gained from situations that I have experienced. This is important because eventually when working as a full-time radiographer, I must be able to make a decision based on my judgement of what is the right thing to do. This will show my independence and deepen my understanding of what I am learning, while not constantly relying on seniors for questions.
                <br><br>
                An example of a time I have demonstrated judgement, is during my time as a casual radiographer at a private clinical practice. Here, there was a student that was on placement there and I would sometimes be required to teach and demonstrate to the student the things that I have learned. As a casual radiographer at this time, I was expected to make my own judgement when it came to deciding to perform further imaging or if repeated images needed to be done. As such, whenever the student had a question or I was demonstrating to the student a specific view, I would need to be able to explain to the student why I did something a certain way or if something specific was or was not needed based of what I have learned throughout my four clinical placements.
