                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>One of the main learning skills that I was able to develop was the ability to reflect. There were many assignments during our course that required us to reflect afterwards. We were required to reflect on what we thought we did well and what areas we could have improved on. An example of an assignment where we did reflection was during one of our practical exams which was a simulation clinic. We were first split into groups where each group was initially assigned to a patient. Each one of these patients were actors who demonstrated the different types of patients that we would experience in the real world. 
                <br><br>
                One member of the group would interact with the patient one at a time, showcasing our skills of communication with each patient. While each person was having their turn, the other memebers of the group would have to mark them and write down what they believe was done well and what was not. When the person had finished interacting with the patient,the other members of the group and also the actor would provide them with the feedback. At the end of the practical, we were then required to write a reflection on all the things we had learnt to highlight the areas that we were great at but also the areas that each person needed to improve on. 
                
                I believe that being able to reflect is a very important skill that we need to continuosly improve oneself. It allows us to see our mistakes and fix them and can also give us new ideas on how to tackle different situations.
                <br><br>
                Here is evidence of my ability to reflect.
